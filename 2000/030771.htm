第三章测试<br>
<br>
1、A. Getting your thoughts down on paper is not the final stage of writing a 
good paragraph or essay. B. There remains the rewriting of the first draft so as 
to shape your idea into a carefully style composition. C. Finally, for 
smoothness and balance, changes are made between sentences or paragraphs. D. A 
different word may be substituted for the original word because it is easier to 
understand, is more colorful, gives a more precise meaning, or provides variety. 
E. Ordinarily, editing involves changes at three points: in individual words, 
within sentences, and between sentences. F. At the sentence level, phrases may 
be put in different order, structures of modification revised, different verb 
structures selected, or the length of phrases or whole sentences may be altered. 
G. At the word level, spelling and capitalization are checked, but more 
creatively, words are often changed. H. Such changes, designed to clarify 
relationships between ideas, are often accomplished by punctuating more 
adequately, by introducing more effective transitional devices, or by restating 
or removing awkward phrases and sentences. I. Editing then—the self-conscious 
appraisal and revision of your own work—usually makes the difference between a 
merely acceptable and a truly superior piece of writing.<br>

1、Read the following paragraphs carefully and rearrange the paragraphs 
Paragraph1. I believe that advances in technology make the world better. The 
following are three reasons that I have to support my opinion. A. Next, advances 
in technology allow people to be more connected with each other. The Internet, 
for example, has allowed businesses and people to communicate with each other 
much more easily than older methods such as phone, fax or mail. B. Many people 
oppose advances in technology because they are both worried of the current level 
of technology and afraid of potential problems that may be caused by future 
technologies. However, the most important point to remember is that technology 
will always be advancing, whether we want it to or not. Therefore, the best way 
to deal with this situation is to think about ways we can ensure that future 
advances in technology will not harm our quality of life. To put it another way, 
we cannot sacrifice our well-being for future conveniences. C. To begin with, 
technology makes the world better because it helps business people do their 
business more efficiently. Information technology and computers have made it 
possible for complicated tasks to be done in much less time than it would have 
taken without them. D. To sum up, I believe that technological advancement makes 
the world better! Furthermore, the potential dangers of technological 
advancement can be prevented by standards and regulations that protect the 
environment and uphold our morals. E. Finally, technology can help us to solve 
problems, even problems that other technologies created in the first place! On 
many occasions technology is developed and put into use before people know all 
of the potential negative side effects. Further research, however, can develop 
the technology even more so that we can take advantage of its benefits while 
avoiding its potential shortcomings.<br><font color="red" style="font-size: 24px">A、CAEBD</font><br>

1、Read the following disordered complaint letter and then rearrange the order: 
A. 26 May , 2018 B. I bought the hair drier – a RAVLON 405 – on Sunday 22nd May. 
Unfortunately, the first time I tried to use it the handle became extremely hot 
and within a few minutes part of the plastic casing began to melt. I had to turn 
it off immediately. C. To resolve the problem, I would appreciate it if you 
could send me a full refund as soon as possible. Enclosed are the hair drier and 
a copy of the original receipt. D. Yours faithfully, Ms Sabrina Sari E. 48 Hill 
Road, London, SE1 6PN. F. Then I returned it with the receipt to your shop on 
Monday. I explained the situation to one of the assistant and asked for my money 
back but was told I had to speak to you. Unfortunately you were not available 
that day so I am writing instead. G. The Manager Design Shop, 12 Abbey Gate, 
London, NW3 5AP. H. I am writing to complain about a hair drier bought in your 
shop last Sunday and about the treatment I received when I tried to return it a 
few days later. I. I look forward to your reply and a resolution to my problem.

第六章测试<br>
1【阅读理解（选择）/完型填空】 (100分)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [A] As never before in their long history, 
universities have become instruments of national competition as well as 
instruments of peace. They are the place of the scientific discoveries that move 
economies forward, and the primary means of educating the talent required to 
obtain and maintain competitive advantage. But at the same time, the opening of 
national borders to the flow of goods, services, information and especially 
people has made universities a powerful force for global integration, mutual 
understanding and geopolitical stability.<br>
　　[B] In response to the same forces that have driven the world economy, 
universities have become more self¬consciously global: seeking students from 
around the world who represent the entire range of cultures and values, sending 
their own students abroad to prepare them for global careers, offering courses 
of study that address the challenges of an interconnected world and 
collaborative (合作的)research programs to advance science for the benefit of all 
humanity.<br>
　　[C] Of the forces shaping higher education none is more sweeping than the 
movement across borders. Over the past three decades the number of students 
leaving home each year to study abroad has grown at an annual rate of 3.9 
percent, from 800,000 in 1975 to 2.5 million in 2004. Most travel from one 
developed nation to another, but the flow from developing to developed countries 
is growing rapidly. The reverse flow, from developed to developing countries, is 
on the rise, too. Today foreign students earn 30 percent of the doctoral degrees 
awarded in the United States and 38 percent of those in the United Kingdom. And 
the number crossing borders for undergraduate study is growing as well, to 8 
percent of the undergraduates at America’s best institutions and 10 percent of 
all undergraduates in the U.K. In the United States, 20 percent of the newly 
hired professors in science and engineering are foreign-born, and in China many 
newly hired faculty members at the top research universities received their 
graduate education abroad.<br>
　　[D] Universities are also encouraging students to spend some of their 
undergraduate years in another country. In Europe, more than 140,000 students 
participate in the Erasmus program each year, taking courses for credit in one 
of 2,200 participating institutions across the continent. And in the United 
States, institutions are helping place students in summer internships (实习)abroad 
to prepare them for global careers. Yale and Harvard have led the way, offering 
every undergraduate at least one international study or internship 
opportunity—and providing the financial resources to make it possible.<br>
　　[E] Globalization is also reshaping the way research is done. One new trend 
involves sourcing portions of a research program to another country. Yale 
professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator Tian Xu directs a　my 
14research center focused on the genetics of human disease at Shanghai’s Fudan 
University, in collaboration with faculty colleagues from both schools. The 
Shanghai center has 95 employees and graduate students working in a 
4,300-square-meter laboratory facility. Yale faculty, postdoctors and graduate 
students visit regularly and attend videoconference seminars with scientists 
from both campuses. The arrangement benefits both countries; Xu’s Yale lab is 
more productive, thanks to the lower costs of conducting research in China, and 
Chinese graduate students, postdoctors and faculty get on-the-job training from 
a world-class scientist and his U.S. team.<br>
　　[F] As a result of its strength in science, the United States has consistently 
led the world in the commercialization of major new technologies, from the 
mainframe computer and integrated circuit of the 1960s to the Internet 
infrastructure (基础设施)and applications software of the 1990s. The link between 
university-based science and industrial application is often indirect but 
sometimes highly visible: Silicon Valley was intentionally created by Stanford 
University, and Route 128 outside Boston has long housed companies spun off from 
MIT and Harvard. Around the world, governments have encouraged copying of this 
model, perhaps most successfully in Cambridge, England, where Microsoft and 
scores of other leading software and biotechnology companies have set up shop 
around the university.<br>
　　[G] For all its success, the United States remains deeply hesitant about 
sustaining the research-university model. Most politicians recognize the link 
between investment in science and national economic strength, but support for 
research funding has been unsteady. The budget of the National Institutes of 
Health doubled between 1998 and 2003, but has risen more slowly than inflations 
since then. Support for the physical sciences and engineering barely kept pace 
with inflation during that same period. The attempt to make up lost ground is 
welcome, but the nation would be better served by steady, predictable increases 
in science funding at the rate of long-term GDP growth, which is on the order of 
inflation plus 3 percent per year.<br>
　　[H] American politicians have great difficulty recognizing that admitting more 
foreign students can greatly promote the national interest by increasing 
international understanding. Adjusted for inflation, public funding for 
international exchanges and foreign-language study is well below the levels of 
40 years ago. In the wake of September 11, changes in the visa process caused a 
dramatic decline in the number of foreign students seeking admission to U.S. 
universities, and a corresponding surge in enrollments in Australia, Singapore 
and the U.K. Objections from American university and business leaders led to 
improvements in the process and a reversal of the decline, but the United States 
is still seen by many as unwelcoming to international students.<br>
　　[I] Most Americans recognize that universities contribute to the nation’s 
well-being through their scientific research, but many fear that foreign 
students threaten American competitiveness by taking their knowledge and skills 
back home. They fail to grasp that welcoming foreign students to the United 
States has two important positive effects: first, the very best of them stay in 
the States and—like immigrants throughout history—strengthen the nation; and 
second, foreign students who study in the United States become ambassadors for 
many of its most cherished (珍视)values when they return home. Or at least they 
understand them better. In America as elsewhere, few instruments of foreign 
policy are as effective in promoting peace and stability as welcoming 
international university students.<br>
